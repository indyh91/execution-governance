# PROOF_SKETCH

## Purpose

This document provides a **proof sketch** for the canonical claim defined in `CLAIM.md`.

It explains **why execution-time correctness enforcement at the irreversible execution boundary is possible in principle**, independent of any specific implementation, runtime, or domain.

This is not an empirical report and does not rely on experimental outcomes.

---

## Definitions

**Irreversible Execution Boundary**  
The point at which an autonomous system initiates an action that causes a non-idempotent, externally irreversible state change.

**Intent to Act**  
The internal proposal or decision generated by an autonomous system to perform an action.

**Authority to Act**  
The externally enforced permission for an action to be executed in the environment.

**Execution Governance Layer**  
A non-bypassable control layer positioned between intent and execution that holds final authority over whether an action may execute.

**Veto**  
A deterministic denial of execution that prevents the action from occurring.

**Suppression**  
The intentional non-execution of an action due to absence of positive authorization.

---

## Core Insight

The historical impossibility of execution-time correctness enforcement arises from a **category error**:

> Treating *decision correctness* as equivalent to *execution correctness*.

This work separates these concerns.

Correctness at execution time does **not** require the system to know that an action is correct.  
It only requires the system to **withhold execution** unless correctness is explicitly authorized.

---

## Structural Separation

The proof relies on a strict separation of roles:

1. **Decision System**
   - Generates intent
   - May be probabilistic
   - May be uncertain
   - May be incorrect

2. **Execution Governance System**
   - Evaluates authorization
   - Is deterministic
   - Holds final authority
   - Cannot be overridden by intent

This separation is structural, not behavioral.

---

## Authority Decoupling Lemma

**Lemma:**  
If authority to execute is decoupled from intent to execute, then execution-time correctness can be enforced independently of decision quality.

**Reasoning:**

- Intent alone cannot cause execution
- Execution requires explicit authorization
- Authorization is evaluated at execution time
- Absence of authorization deterministically prevents execution

Therefore, incorrect or unsafe intent cannot result in irreversible action.

---

## Veto Sufficiency Argument

Let:

- `A` be a proposed irreversible action
- `G(A)` be the governance evaluation function
- `G(A) ∈ {ALLOW, DENY}`

If:

- `DENY` results in non-execution
- `ALLOW` is required for execution
- `DENY` is the default state in absence of proof

Then:

- All executions satisfy `G(A) = ALLOW`
- All unsafe or unverified actions result in `DENY`
- No unsafe irreversible action can execute

This holds regardless of how `A` was generated.

---

## Suppression as Correctness

Traditional systems treat non-execution as failure.

This proof requires a different correctness criterion:

> **Inaction is correct when authorization is absent.**

Under this criterion:

- Suppression is a valid terminal outcome
- System safety does not depend on predicting correctness
- Failure modes collapse from *catastrophic* to *benign inaction*

This reframing is essential.

---

## Non-Bypassability Requirement

The proof assumes a single necessary condition:

> All irreversible actions must pass through the governance layer.

If bypass exists, correctness enforcement is impossible.

If bypass does not exist, correctness enforcement is guaranteed by construction.

This is a binary property, not a probabilistic one.

---

## Timing Argument

The governance evaluation occurs:

- Immediately prior to execution
- After intent formation
- Before irreversible state change

Therefore:

- Stale assumptions are minimized
- Execution context is current
- Authorization reflects live state

This resolves the historical objection that safety decisions are always temporally misaligned.

---

## Why This Was Previously Considered Impossible

Past approaches failed because they:

- Collapsed decision and execution into one system
- Required predictive certainty instead of authorization certainty
- Relied on post-execution detection
- Assumed rollback was always possible
- Treated suppression as unacceptable failure

None of these constraints are necessary.

---

## Conclusion

By:

- Decoupling authority from intent
- Enforcing non-bypassable execution mediation
- Granting veto power as final
- Treating suppression as correctness
- Evaluating authorization at execution time

Execution-time correctness enforcement becomes **structurally guaranteed**, not probabilistic.

Therefore, the claim in `CLAIM.md` holds in principle.

This completes the proof sketch.
