## Scope of Canonical Material

This canonical version includes the following documents:

- `docs/CLAIM.md`
- `docs/PROOF_SKETCH.md`
- `docs/WHY_EXISTING_APPROACHES_FAIL.md`
- `docs/ADVERSARIAL_LIMITS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_ABSTRACTION.md`
- `docs/EXPOSURE_POLICY.md`

- the problem class
- the claimed capability
- the proof sketch
- the inevitability argument
- the adversarial boundaries
- the architectural solution class
- the disclosure policy

No other files are required to interpret the claim.

## Immutability Statement

The materials listed above are **frozen** as of the freeze date.

Future changes, if any, will:
- be additive
- be clearly versioned
